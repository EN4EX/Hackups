# HTML - Source Code

## Assignment

We have been given a password field to find a password in order to pass this level.



## Analyze

Once we start the challenge we will be shown the login portal. Due to the name of the challenge, I would first look at the source code of the page by pressing `CTRL+U` to see if there is a password hiding there. After analyzing the source code we can notice that the password is indeed there. Now we just copy and paste it into the challenge homepage and we're done.



## Findings

We learnt a little bit about source code and analysis of it in this level.
