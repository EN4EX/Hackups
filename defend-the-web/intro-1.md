# Intro 1

## Assignment&#x20;

We have been given a login form to try find correct credentials in order to pass through this level. ​&#x20;



## Analyze

In title is written: "This is the first level so don’t expect anything to complicated." I have expirience with multiple challenges where I had to find correct login form credentials and in the most easiest level they were hiding as a comment in web source code so lets start with that. ​



## Findings&#x20;

Lets try opening a source code of given website by pressing ctrl+u. Instead of scrolling trough numerous lines of code we can just simply search for it by pressing ctrl+f and typing something like: "username" and after that we should be immediately given a highligted words that say _username_ one of the line where "username" is highlighted is a comment and in that comment is given both username and password. Now we can just simply copy and paste it and we just completed Intro 1.
