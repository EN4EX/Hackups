# Intro 2

## Assignment

We have been given a login form in which we must type a correct pair of credentials which will let us pass this level.



## Analyze

In last intro level we tried the source code method where we firstly look into soource code. In this intro we can start the same. Go ahead and press ctrl+u with that the source code of level opens up. Again we can simplify our work and just search for it instead of manually scrolling between lines of codes. To search press ctrl+f and simply type: "username" to be honest I didn't expect to be solution this similiar to Intro 1. This time its in `<label>` and not in comment. Below that we can see same thing but with password. So lets try to input this into the login form ad lets see if it works. And its correct.



## Findings

We dived into source code again and simplified our work by few tools offered by browser. We also learn few shortcuts in combination with ctrl.
