# Crypt 2

## Assignment

We have been given a text to decrypt it and find a password in order to pass this level.



## Analyze

We can see in the text a lots of "w" which can possibly indicate a ROT encryption method. We can now go to [cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/) a very helpful tool that offer a numerous both encryption and decryption algorithms to use. We can simply use a search field and type ROT in that. We got listed ROT13, ROt 47 etc. that are our main algorithms we want to use. We can assume that it might be a ROT13 because that only shifts alphabet not symobls and stuff like thatso in this case it will be more useful. But we might no know the amount of shifting to use with ROT13... Thats why there is another thing called "ROT13 Brute Force" which can help us indentify that amount. We just have to scroll a little bit until we see a plain readable text.



## Findings

We learnt a little bit about Cyberchef in this level and little bit about ROT encryption methods.
