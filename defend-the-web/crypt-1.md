# Crypt 1

## Assignment

We have been given a text to decrypt it and find a password in order to pass this level.



## Analyze

If we take a close look at the text especially at the last word if we reading it from left to right. We can see that its reversed "Hello" and that could give us a hint of what the decryption method is.



## Findings

We can simply read text from right to left and at the end is written "pass:" and after that we got our password.
